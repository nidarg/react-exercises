🔹 useRef Hook – All Use Cases with Examples
🔹 What is useRef?
The useRef hook in React is used for:
✅ Accessing & modifying DOM elements
✅ Storing values without causing re-renders
✅ Keeping a reference to previous state values
✅ Handling timers & intervals

Unlike useState, changing a useRef value does NOT trigger a re-render.
🔹 When to Use useRef Instead of useState?
Use Case	useRef	useState
Accessing DOM elements	✅ Yes	❌ No
Storing values without re-rendering	✅ Yes	❌ No
Tracking previous state	✅ Yes	❌ No
Triggering UI updates	❌ No	✅ Yes
Managing timers & intervals	✅ Yes	❌ No
🚀 Final Thoughts
✅ useRef is not reactive—changing ref.current does not trigger re-renders.
✅ Use useRef for DOM manipulation, timers, previous state tracking, and storing values without re-renders.
✅ For state updates that trigger re-renders, use useState instead.
