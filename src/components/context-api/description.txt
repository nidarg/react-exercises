The Context API in React is a built-in state management solution that allows data to be shared across the component tree without prop drilling. It provides a way to pass data like themes, authentication status, or global state directly to components, eliminating the need to pass props manually at every level.

How It Works:
Create a Context – Using React.createContext(), you define a context.
Provide the Context – Wrap components with a Provider to make the data accessible.
Consume the Context – Use useContext or Context.Consumer to access the provided values in child components.

Why Use Context API?
✅ Avoids prop drilling
✅ Simplifies state management for global data
✅ Lightweight compared to Redux for simple use cases
